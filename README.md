### Hey guys Bangy here 👋
#### Here are some facts about me
* I'm a software engineer - like the bald alien from prometheus.
* I'm becoming a doctor in computer science - this means when computers gets sick I grab my stethoscope and listen to their CPU clock cycles.
* I struggle with math (thanks, ADHD or possibly low IQ), but I’m hopelessly obsessed with rigor, formality, and elegance. (*bows dramatically*)

#### What I Work On

* 🧩 **Machine Learning & AI** - RAG systems, time-series modeling, multimodal transformers
* ⚙️ **Embedded Systems** - ESP32, STM32, FPGA design, and digital logic tinkering
* 🌐 **Software Engineering** - From microcontrollers to full-stack (Flask, React, Rust, Python)
* **\{∅\}** **Pure Mathematics** - Mostly category theory applications in analytic philosophy - trying to construct an analytic *theory of everything*.
* 🎨 **Digital Art & Animation** - I run [**BangyStudios**](https://www.youtube.com/@Bangy) for creative and educational projects
